## Description
I initially was tasked with a assignment to create a simple weather website using an api key that will produce weather information. When I first started this assignment back in May I was having a tough time, so my goal was to get as much as I can done and come back to this assignment on a later day when I feel more comfortable. When I first started I was okay with understanding html but for other langauges such as Javascript and CSS I was pretty clueless. My biggest problems I was running into with CSS was flex boxes and responsive web designs. At the time when I first started this assignment I didnt really have a good foundation for understanding these concepts but these were things I need to understand because they are crucial. 6 months later and I have a better understanding of the two and I able to say it was worth it. Now for Javascript, when I was implementing my Javascript code for the first assignment it would produce the weather information but it would only produce this for just one day or for better understanding my html file would only show the weather for my main container or day. So now I needed to spend some extra time with my Javascript to understand why this was happening, then i found other things out such as how my temperature and wind value wasn't calculated correctly, my search history wasn't displaying any data, and then I also found out ways where instead of display day 1, day 2 etc. I could display The days of the week Sunday-Saturday and also found ways to produce the search city in the weather displayed containers. This was a crucial assignment for me because I actually was able to take control of my learning instead of cruising in autopilot.
